	For running matlab API, mat.h and matrix.h folder should be included which is in MATLAB/extern/include.
	Also, in Properties/Linker/Input, libmx.lib and libmat.lib should be added as dependencies since those are defined in headers.
	Which means, all the matlab dll should be copied into project folder for safety considerations.

	Basic .mat file read success. For material map (uint16), unsigned short type is needed to copy the data.
